5. [ ] Click Save

### Step 1.5: Add Your Personal Profile as Admin
1. [ ] Go to the ProposalForge.io page → Admin tools (or Settings)
2. [ ] Add yourself as a Page Admin (you should be auto-added as creator)

## PHASE 2: Week 1 – Problem & Credibility

**Goal:** Make people feel the pain. Build trust.

### Step 2.1: Monday – Post #1 (Problem / Story)
1. [ ] Go to [linkedin.com](https://linkedin.com)
2. [ ] **Switch to post as ProposalForge.io:** Click "Start a post" → Click your profile picture/name at the bottom → Select "ProposalForge.io" from the dropdown (so the post shows as from the page, not you)
3. [ ] Write (company voice—"we" / "freelancers"):

   ```
   𝗧𝗿𝘂𝗲 𝗼𝗿 𝗳𝗮𝗹𝘀𝗲:
   
   You've spent 2+ hours on an Upwork proposal and got 0 response.
   
   If that's you—you're not alone.
   
   Freelancers tell us the proposal game is the hardest part. You tailor each one. You research the client. You try to stand out. And crickets.
   
   What's your biggest proposal frustration? Drop it below 👇
   ```

4. [ ] Keep it 100–200 words
5. [ ] Add 3–5 hashtags: #Upwork #Freelancing #ProposalWriting #FreelancerLife
6. [ ] Post between 8–10 AM or 12–2 PM (your timezone)
7. [ ] Set a reminder to check comments in 2 hours
8. [ ] Reply to every comment as ProposalForge.io (within 2–4 hours)

### Step 2.2: Wednesday – Post #2 (Quick Tip)
1. [ ] Open LinkedIn → Start a post → **Select "ProposalForge.io"** so you post as the page
2. [ ] Write:

   ```
   3 things that kill Upwork proposals:
   
   1) Generic openings ("Hi, I'm a freelancer...")
   2) Talking about yourself first (client doesn't care yet)
   3) Ignoring the client's pain points
   
   The best proposals lead with: "I understand you need X. Here's how I've done it before."
   
   Which one do you catch yourself doing?
   ```

3. [ ] Add hashtags. Post. Reply to every comment.

### Step 2.3: Friday – Post #3 (Poll)
1. [ ] Open LinkedIn → Start a post → **Select "ProposalForge.io"**
2. [ ] Click the poll icon (bar chart)
3. [ ] Question: "How many Upwork proposals do you send per week?"
4. [ ] Options: 1–5 | 6–15 | 16–30 | 30+
5. [ ] In the caption, add: "And how many actually get a reply? Be honest 👇"
6. [ ] Post. Reply to every comment.

### Step 2.4: Daily (Every Day of Week 1)
1. [ ] Spend 30–45 min on LinkedIn
2. [ ] **From your personal profile:** Search "Upwork" or "freelancer proposal"
3. [ ] Find 5–10 posts from others (not ads)
4. [ ] Leave genuine comments from your personal account (2–3 sentences, add value)
5. [ ] When relevant, mention ProposalForge.io: "We're building something for this—ProposalForge.io. Follow our page for updates."
6. [ ] Go to the ProposalForge.io page → check posts → reply to every comment as the page
7. [ ] Do NOT spam. Be helpful first.

   We've been building something for the past few weeks.

1. [ ] Open LinkedIn → Start a post → **Select "ProposalForge.io"**
