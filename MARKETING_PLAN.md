---

## Part 1: Foundation (Before You Post Anything)

### 1.1 Define Your Target Audience
- **Primary:** Tech freelancers on Upwork (QA, Business Analysis, Product Owner, Product Manager, Project Manager, Dev, DevOps)
- **Secondary:** Freelancers who struggle with proposal writing or get few responses
- **Pain points:** Low response rates, time spent on proposals, fear of sounding generic

### 1.2 Your Core Message (Use This Everywhere)
> "ProposalForge.io helps you write winning Upwork proposals—without auto-submitting. You stay in control, Upwork stays happy, and your proposals get noticed."

### 1.3 LinkedIn Company Page Prep (Do This First)
**Strategy:** Market via a separate ProposalForge.io LinkedIn Company Page—not your personal profile.

- [ ] **Create Company Page:** linkedin.com/company/setup/new → Name: ProposalForge.io, add website, industry
- [ ] **Logo:** 300 x 300 px (Canva)
- [ ] **Banner:** 1128 x 376 px, text: "Coming soon: ProposalForge.io – Win more Upwork proposals"
- [ ] **Tagline:** "AI-optimized Upwork proposals. You apply. We help you write."
- [ ] **About:** 2–3 sentences on what ProposalForge.io does, no auto-submit, launching soon
- [ ] **Get followers:** Share page with connections, invite them to follow

See [MARKETING_STEPS.md](./MARKETING_STEPS.md) for step-by-step page setup.

### 1.4 Create a Simple Landing Page (If You Don't Have One)
- Email signup: "Get notified when we launch"
- One sentence: what it does
- "No auto-submit. You apply. We help you write."

## Part 2: 4-Week Content Calendar

**Posting:** All posts go from the **ProposalForge.io LinkedIn Company Page** (not your personal profile). Use "we" / company voice. Your personal profile is for engaging with others and driving them to follow the page.

### Week 1: Problem & Credibility

**Goal:** Make people feel the pain and trust you.

| Day | Post Type | Topic | What to Write |
|-----|-----------|-------|---------------|
| Mon | Story | Your own struggle | "I spent 2 hours on an Upwork proposal last week. Got 0 response. Sound familiar?" Share a short personal story about proposal frustration. |
| Wed | Tip | Quick advice | "3 things that kill Upwork proposals: 1) Generic openings 2) Talking about yourself first 3) Ignoring the client's pain points. Which one do you do?" |
| Fri | Poll | Engagement | "How many Upwork proposals do you send per week?" Options: 1–5, 6–15, 16–30, 30+. Ask in caption: "And how many actually get a reply?" |

**Posting tips:**
- Keep posts 100–200 words. Short = more reads.
- End with a question to get comments.
- Reply to every comment within 2–4 hours.

### Week 2: Tease the Solution

**Goal:** Hint that you're building something. Don't reveal the product yet.

| Day | Post Type | Topic | What to Write |
|-----|-----------|-------|---------------|
| Mon | Teaser | Building something | "I've been working on something for the past few weeks. It's for freelancers who are tired of writing proposals that go nowhere. More soon." |
| Wed | Myth bust | Auto-submit danger | "PSA: Tools that auto-submit Upwork proposals can get your account banned. Upwork's ToS is clear. I'm building something different—you stay in control." |
| Fri | Behind the scenes | Process | "Screenshot of my notes: 'Match score before you apply' 'Keyword gap analysis' 'Tone options' Building in public is scary. But here we go." |

**Posting tips:**
- Use "building in public" language—people love transparency.
- Don't name the product yet. Create curiosity.
- If someone asks what it is: "Still in the works. I'll share more next week!"

---

### Week 3: Reveal & Differentiate

**Goal:** Introduce ProposalForge.io. Emphasize the "no auto-submit" angle.

| Day | Post Type | Topic | What to Write |
|-----|-----------|-------|---------------|
| Mon | Reveal | Product intro | "Introducing ProposalForge.io. It helps you write AI-optimized Upwork proposals. You paste the job, add your skills, and get a proposal that stands out. You still apply yourself. No bots. No ban risk." |
| Wed | Comparison | vs competitors | "ProposalForge.io vs auto-submit tools: They apply for you (risky). We help you write (safe). They spam. We help you tailor. Your account, your control." |
| Fri | Feature highlight | Match score | "One feature I'm proud of: Check your match score BEFORE you waste time writing. See if you're a strong fit, then generate. No more applying to jobs you'll never win." |

**Posting tips:**
- Add a simple mockup or screenshot if you have one.
- Pin the "Introducing ProposalForge.io" post to your profile.
- Start saying "launching in 1 week" in comments.

---

### Week 4: Countdown & Launch Prep

**Goal:** Build urgency. Get email signups. Prepare for launch day.

| Day | Post Type | Topic | What to Write |
|-----|-----------|-------|---------------|
| Mon | Countdown | 7 days | "ProposalForge.io launches in 7 days. If you want early access, drop a comment with 'interested' or sign up at [link]. I'll personally onboard the first 50." |
| Wed | Social proof | Early interest | "Already 30+ people signed up. If you're a QA, BA, PO, PM, or DevOps freelancer on Upwork—this is for you. Link in comments." |
| Fri | Launch eve | Tomorrow | "Tomorrow. ProposalForge.io goes live. Thank you to everyone who engaged, asked questions, and signed up. See you on the other side." |

**Posting tips:**
- Post the signup link in the first comment (LinkedIn limits link visibility in posts).
- Reply to every "interested" with a thank you and the link.
- Consider a LinkedIn poll: "Would you use a tool that helps write Upwork proposals (you still apply yourself)?" Yes / Maybe / No
